Our project uses computational physics, accurately simulating gravity to model the motion of planets in space. By tracing the path of these planets, we were able to create "revolutionary" works of art.

We used Python and Pygame to model the GUI aspect of our project. We used Pillow to handle images throughout our program, and utilized advanced computational physics to model the movement of planets through the solar system. Using the universal law of gravitation, we modeled accurate motion of planets in the solar system.

We initially attempted to use artificial intelligence and machine learning, like deep learning models and genetic algorithms, to reverse-engineer our model. With this approach, we would be able to pass an image to our neural network and find the initial planet locations/velocities. Then, by running our simulation, we could see the image being drawn by planets in realtime.

We are proud to have created a physics-based simulation from scratch that produces beautiful art. With this simulation, we are able to set the locations and initial velocities of planets and run the simulation to see the artwork that it could produce.

In the future, our simulation could be used to model other solar systems. It could also be used to study the n-body problem, a famous problem in computational physics. The n-body problem states that the smallest deviation in initial positions and velocities in a system with 3 or more bodies will compound and generate a vastly different result as time passes.
